                       Definitions:
"out of density":  RHO < 2 SD below 1/2 mean density for this atom/group
"very weak density":  RHO < 1 SD below 1/2 mean density for this atom/group
"weak density":  RHO < 1/2 mean density for this atom/group
"acceptable density":  No atom is < 1 SD below 1/2 mean for that atom type and
no group is < 1/2 mean for that group

"DENSITY" is the electron density in the map, normalized so that 
the mean and SD in the region of the model are zero and 1.0, respectively.
